# Voxloud Homework Assignment: Weather Dashboard

**Objective:** Build a simple weather dashboard application that displays detailed weather information for multiple cities.

## Requirements:

1. **Application Overview:**
   - Create a simple weather dashboard that allows users to add multiple cities and view their current weather conditions.
   - Each city's card should display:
     - City name
     - Current temperature
     - Weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy)
     - Option to remove the city from the dashboard.

2. **Technical Requirements:**
   - Use latest **Angular**
   - Fetch weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
   - Implement the following features:
     - An input field to enter a city name and a button to add it to the dashboard.
     - A display of all added cities, each in its own card.
     - Use **RxJS** to handle API requests and manage the response data.
     - Implement a loading indicator while fetching data.
     - Implement error handling to manage cases where the city is not found.
   - Style the dashboard using **CSS** or **Sass**, ensuring a responsive design.
     Using helper style libraries like Tailwind is allowed.
   - Write unit tests for components and services using **Jasmine/Karma**.

3. **Additional Features (Optional):**
   - Save the list of cities in local storage so that they persist across page refreshes.
   - Allow users to view the forecast for the next few days for each city.
   - Add some fancy animations

4. **Submission:**
   - Use this repo as a starting point for your journey
   - Host the code in a public repository (e.g., GitHub) and provide the link.
   - Include a README file with setup instructions and details on any API keys used.
